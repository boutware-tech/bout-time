=Values=

These values are used in many of the drop-down lists throughout the application.  Most of these values are set when the tournament is [HowToStartANewTournament first created].

The *Bout Times* value is a comma-separated list of bout period times.  You can also specify different period times for the winner's side and the consolation side of the bracket. To do this, use a hyphen between the times. For example, "2:00-1:30". The winner's side is first (2:00) and the consolation side is last (1:30).  So you could have a list like this : "1:00,1:30-1:00,2:00-1:30".

The *Bouts watermark* value is a comma-separated list of classifications that a "watermark" label will be added to when generating boutsheet reports.  See [http://bout-time.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sample/reports/Watermark-boutsheet.pdf this] for an example.

The *Brackets watermark* value is a comma-separated list of classifications that a "watermark" label will be added to when generating bracket reports.  See [http://bout-time.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sample/reports/Watermark-bracket.pdf this] for an example.

=Reports=

These values are used when generating reports.  

*Bracketsheet Timestamp* : whenever a bracket report is generated, a timestamp can be included.  This timestamp will appear in the lower left corner.  You can choose to always include this timestamp, never include it, or be asked (prompted) each time a bracket report is generated.  

*Bracketsheet Award Image* : Award-style bracket reports can include a tournament image/logo.  To do this, specify the file for the image and where you would like the image to appear on the page.

  * If you choose to place the image in the "Upper Right", be sure the image is the right size _(142 x 142 pixels)_ so it won't cover any of the bracket information.  See [http://bout-time.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sample/reports/AwardBracket-upperRight.pdf this] for an example.

  * If you choose to place the image in the "Center", bout-time will put it in the background.  However, bout-time will *not* lighten or fade the image.  The image you provide will appear as-is.  See [http://bout-time.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sample/reports/AwardBracket-center.pdf this] for an example.
