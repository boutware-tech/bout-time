=== Enter Values ===
Enter the values to be used by the application.  These are all optional and can be changed later.  Click *Next* when done.

  * *Classifications* : Classifications for the entries, like Open and Rookie, or Varsity and Jr. Varsity.
  * *Age Divisions* : Age divisions.
  * *Weight Classes* : Weight classes.
  * *Mats* : Mat numbers.
  * *Sessions* : Tournament sessions, like AM and PM.
  * *Bout Times* : Times used for bout periods.  For example, younger age divisions may have different/shorter bout period times than older age divisions.  You can also specify different period times for the winner's side and the consolation side of the bracket.  To do this, use a hyphen between the times.  For example, "2:00-1:30".  The winner's side is first (2:00) and the consolation side is last (1:30).  So you could have a list like this : "1:00,1:30-1:00,2:00-1:30".
