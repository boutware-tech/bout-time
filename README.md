# bout-time
 A Java application to administer an amateur wrestling tournament

This is a standalone Java application that eases the administration of amateur wrestling tournaments, especially those with multiple age groups and multiple wrestler classifications (Rookie, Open, etc.). Since it is written in Java, it can be used on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).

bout-time has the ability to handle both static groupings (defined by age and weight class) and dynamic groupings (defined by the administrator).

Wrestler entries can be input in batches by file (CSV, MS Excel, or XML) or individually (via a form).

bout-time offers the ability to seed wrestlers, assign groupings to a mat, assign bout numbers to bouts, and assign finishing places (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) to winners.

All reports are in PDF format for easy viewing, printing, and archiving.
